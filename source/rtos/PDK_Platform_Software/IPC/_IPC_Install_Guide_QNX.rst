Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inter/Intra Processor Communication (IPC) is a product designed to
enable communication between processors in a multi-processor
environment. Features of IPC include message passing, multi-processor
gates, shared memory primitives, and more.

IPC is designed for use with processors running SYS/BIOS applications.
This is typically an ARM or DSP. IPC includes support for High Level
Operating Systems (HLOS) like Linux, as well as the SYS/BIOS RTOS. The
breadth of IPC features supported in an HLOS environment is reduced in
an effort to simplify the product.

Install
^^^^^^^^

IPC is often distributed and installed within a larger SDK. In those
cases, no installation is required.

Outside of an SDK, `IPC can be downloaded
here <http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ipc/index.html>`__,
and is released as a zip file. To install, simply extract the file.

::

    buildhost$ unzip ipc_<version>.zip

This will extract the IPC product in a directory with its product name
and version information (e.g. **c:/ti/ipc_<version>**)

.. note::

  -  This document assumes the IPC install path to be the user's home
     directory on a Linux host machine (**/home/<user>**) or the user's
     main drive on a Windows host machine (**C:\\**). The variable
     **IPC_INSTALL_DIR** will be used throughout the document. If IPC was
     installed at a different location, make appropriate changes to
     commands.
  -  Some customers find value in archiving the released sources in a
     configuration management system. This can help in identifying any
     changes made to the original sources - often useful when updating to
     newer releases.

Build
^^^^^^^

The IPC product often comes with prebuilt SYS/BIOS-side libraries, so
rebuilding them isn't necessary. The QNX-side libraries/binaries may
also be provided prebuilt by SDK programs, but the standalone IPC
release does not currently pre-build them.

IPC provides GNU makefile(s) to rebuild all its libraries at the base of
the product, details are below.

.. note::
  GNU make version 3.81 or greater is required. The XDC tools (provided
  with most SDKs and CCS distributions) includes a pre-compiled version of
  GNU make 3.81 in $(XDC_INSTALL_DIR)/gmake.

products.mak
"""""""""""""

IPC contains a **products.mak** file at the root of the product that
specifies the necessary paths and options to build IPC for the various
OS support.

Edit **products.mak** and set the following variables:

-  Variables used by both QNX and BIOS

   -  **PLATFORM** - Device to build for

      -  QNX started using this variable in IPC 3.20. Prior releases
         required setting "DEVICE" for QNX and "PLATFORM" for BIOS. The
         two variables were consolidated in IPC 3.20.
      -  BIOS started leveraging this variable in IPC 3.10. Prior
         releases built BIOS-side executables for **all** supported
         platforms based on that targets/toolchains set above (which can
         take a while!)

-  QNX

   -  **QNX_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to your QNX installation directory.
   -  **DESTDIR** - Path to which target binaries will be exported when
      running the 'make install' goal.
   -  **DEVICE** - (only required for releases prior to IPC 3.20) Device
      to build for

-  SYS/BIOS

   -  **XDC_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to TI's XDCTools installation
   -  **BIOS_INSTALL_DIR** - Path to TI's SYS/BIOS installation
   -  **ti.targets.<device target and file format>** - Path to TI
      toolchain for the device.

      -  Set only the variables to the targets your device supports to
         minimize build time.

   -  **gnu.targets.arm.<device target and file format>** - Path to GNU
      toolchain for the device.

      -  Set only the variables to the targets your device supports to
         minimize build time.

.. note::
  The versions used during validation can be found in the IPC Release
  Notes provided in the product.

.. rubric:: ipc-qnx.mak
   :name: ipc-qnx.mak

The QNX-side build is performed using QNX makefiles. To build using the
components paths set in the **products.mak** file, issue the following
command:

::

    <buildhost> make -f ipc-qnx.mak all

ipc-bios.mak
""""""""""""""

The SYS/BIOS-side IPC is built with a GNU makefile. After editing
**products.mak**, issue the following command:

::

    <buildhost> make -f ipc-bios.mak all

Based on the number of targets you're building for, this may take some
time.

**Note for Windows users:** If you are building with a Windows host
machine and it has the QNX tools installed, you will instead need to run
the following in a separate command prompt window (cmd.exe) to build the
SYS/BIOS side outside of the QNX build environment:

::

    <buildhost> set PATH=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem
    <buildhost> <XDC_INSTALL_DIR>\gmake -f ipc-bios.mak all

where <XDC_INSTALL_DIR> should be replaced with the installation
directory of your XDC tools, same as the path you have used in
products.mak.

Run
^^^^^

The IPC product provides a way to install (copy) the necessary IPC
executables and libraries onto the device's target file-system to
simplify the execution of the applications. The details can vary across
OS's, so this description has been separated into OS-specific sections.

Configuring the BSP
""""""""""""""""""""

Some of the provided IPC tests that use a utility called
SharedMemoryAllocator require a carveout to be created in the QNX-owned
memory. To reserve this memory, you must make the following change in
the file <QNX BSP installation
directory>\src\hardware\startup\boards\<board name>\build in the QNX
BSP. E.g.

::

   startup-omap5432uevm -r 0xBA300000,0x5A00000 -vvvvv -P2 -W

Save the file, then rebuild the QNX OS image (ifs-*.bin) and replace
your existing one with the new one.

Installing Tests in QNX
""""""""""""""""""""""""

To assemble the IPC resource manager, shared libraries and test
executables into a directory structure suitable for running on the
device's file-system, issue the following command in the IPC_INSTALL_DIR
directory:

::

    buildhost$ make -f ipc-qnx.mak install

This will install the binaries into the directory specified by DESTDIR
in products.mak. It this assumed that DESTDIR is a directory visible to
the target filesystem. If not, you should copy its contents to such a
location (e.g. onto an SD card that can be accessed by the EVM).

When building in Windows, some users might get build messages that
report a version mismatch in cygwin:

::

    C:/QNX650/host/win32/x86/usr/bin/make -j 1 -Cle.v7 -fMakefile install
          1 [main] ? (5984) C:\QNX650\host\win32\x86\usr\photon\bin\find.exe: *** fa
    tal error - system shared memory version mismatch detected - 0x8A88009C/0x2D1E009C.
    This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the cygwin DLL.
    Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
    and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
    reside in x:\cygwin\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
    installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
    are unable to find another cygwin DLL.

Based on what we observed the binaries are still exported correctly
despite the messages. If you do want to eliminate them, you should
replace the file cygwin1.dll in
<QNX_INSTALL_DIR>\host\win32\x86\usr\photon\bin with the newest
cygwin1.dll you can find on your host machine (do a search on your PC's
filesystem in Windows).

Some of the tests rely on corresponding remote core applications to be
run on the slave processor(s). The remote processor's applications are
loaded when launching the resource manager. See section
`#IPC_resource_manager <index_Foundational_Components.html#ipc-resource-manager>`__ for details on
launching the resource manager.

The location of the remote core applications within the IPC product
varies based on device.

Installing remote core applications
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Remote core applications can be found in
<IPC_INSTALL_DIR>/packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/ti_platform_<your platform
name>_\* directories.

For example, you can copy the messageq_single.xem4 for OMAP54xx uEVM's
IPU onto the device's target filesystem into the **bin** directory as
follows:

::

    buildhost$ copy <IPC_INSTALL_DIR>/packages/ti/ipc/tests/bin/ti_platform_omap54xx_ipu/messageq_single.xem4 <DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin

'ti_platform_omap54xx_ipu' indicates the platform is 'omap54xx' and the
remote core name is 'IPU'. You only need to copy the binaries relevant
to your platform.

IPC resource manager
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Much of the functionality of IPC is provided by the resource manager. It
can be launched as follows:

::

    target# cd <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin
    target# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/usr/lib
    target# ipc <CORE1> <remote executable 1> <CORE2> <remote executable 2> ...

<CORE> should correspond to the name of the remote core on which you
want the remote executable to be loaded. As a rule of thumb, it is the
capitalized version of the core name specified by the name of the
directory from which the executable was copied in the `#Installing remote core applications
<index_Foundational_Components.html#installing-remote-core-applications>`__
section. For example, if the executable is copied from
"ti_platform_omap54xx\_**ipu**/test_omx_ipu_omap5.xem4", then you should
load it as follows:

::

    target# ipc IPU test_omx_ipu_omap5.xem4

The resource manager will register devices in the pathname space for
communicating with the IPC. Communication with the IPC is only possible
once the needed devices are registered. The following devices are
registered by default when the IPC resource manager is launched:

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Device     | Description                                                   |
+============+===============================================================+
| /dev/tiipc | Provides the "ti-ipc" protocol. Needed by MessageQ APIs.      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| /dev/ipc   | Provides the HWSpinLock functionality. Needed by GateMP APIs. |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Additionally, more devices may be registered by the remote core firmware
if using the "rpmsg-rpc" protocol. In that case, the name that appears
in the pathname space is specified by the remote core firmware.

Later, when you are done running applications that use IPC and no longer
need the resource manager, it can be terminated as follows:

::

    target# cd <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin
    target# slay ipc

Running Test Applications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The QNX-side of the test applications are already on the target's
filesystem in <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin
and <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin/tests,
assuming the `#Installing Tests in QNX <index_Foundational_Components.html#installing-tests-in-qnx>`__ and
`#IPC resource manager <index_Foundational_Components.html#ipc-resource-manager>`__ sections have been
followed and that the resource manager has loaded the remote core(s)
with the executable corresponding to the test you'd like to run.

To find out the syntax to use for running the test (say MessageQApp),
run

::

    target# cd <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin/tests
    target# use MessageQApp

To run a test application, execute it on the target's filesystem:

::

    target# cd <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin/tests
    target# ./MessageQApp 10

Here is a list of the main tests that are available in the IPC product:

-  MessageQApp: Test that creates a single thread that sends messages
   from host to remote core using MessageQ

   -  messageq_single.x\* need to be loaded by the resource manager

-  MessageQMulti: Test that creates multiple threads which send messages
   from host to remote core using MessageQ

   -  messageq_multi.x\* need to be loaded by the resource manager

-  mmrpc_test: Test that exercises MMRPC

   -  test_omx_ipu_<platform>.x\* need to be loaded by the resource
      manager
   -  Aside from the IPC resource manager, this test also needs the
      shmemallocator resource manager to be launched beforehand:

::

         target# cd <target directory corresponding to DESTDIR>/armle-v7/bin
         target# shmemallocator
         target# cd tests
         target# mmrpc_test 1

.. rubric:: Expected output
   :name: expected-output

To give you an idea, the expected output for MessageQApp on the QNX-side
should look similar to this:

::

    Using numLoops: 10; procId : 1
    Entered MessageQApp_execute
    Local MessageQId: 0x1
    Remote queueId  [0x10000]
    Exchanging 10 messages with remote processor IPU...
    MessageQ_get #0 Msg = 0x11c9f0
    Exchanged 1 messages with remote processor IPU
    MessageQ_get #1 Msg = 0x11c9f0
    Exchanged 2 messages with remote processor IPU
    MessageQ_get #2 Msg = 0x11c9f0
    ...
    ...
    Exchanged 9 messages with remote processor IPU
    MessageQ_get #9 Msg = 0x11c9f0
    Exchanged 10 messages with remote processor IPU
    Sample application successfully completed!
    Leaving MessageQApp_execute

The output on the remote processor can be obtained by running the
following on the target filesystem:

::

    target# cat /dev/ipc-trace/IPU

The expected output on the remote processor should look similar to this:

::

Running standalone examples
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

On some platforms, there are standalone examples provided to illustrate
how to use specific features in IPC. These standalone examples are
designed to be easily rebuilt outside of the IPC product, and represent
a good starting point for development. If available, the examples are
located in <IPC_INSTALL_DIR>\examples\archive\<platform of your choice>.

To use the examples, unzip the example you want in a working directory
of your choice. Update the products.mak file in the example's directory
with the installation locations of the various dependent components.
Then build it. E.g.:

::

    buildhost$ unzip ex02_messageq.zip
    buildhost$ cd ex02_messageq
    buildhost$ make clean
    buildhost$ make
    buildhost$ make install

This would produce the host and remote core binaries in an 'install'
subdirectory. **Tip**: Alternatively, for convenience, you can also
extract and rebuild all examples available for your platform at once
with this series of commands:

::

    buildhost$ cd <IPC_INSTALL_DIR>/examples
    buildhost$ make extract
    buildhost$ make
    buildhost$ make install

Next step is to copy the content of the 'install' subdirectory into a
location accessible by your target board (e.g. SD card). Run the example
on the target using IPC by loading the remote cores like you would with
the test applications, then run the example. E.g.:

::

    target# ipc IPU ex02_messageq/debug/server_ipu.xem4 DSP ex02_messageq/debug/server_dsp.xe64T
    target# cd ex02_messageq/debug/
    target# app_host IPU

Advanced topics
""""""""""""""""

Load and unload individual cores while IPC is running (IPC 3.23.01 and above)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In some applications, there may be a need to load or unload cores after
the IPC resource manager is already up and running -- e.g. change the
DSP executable while keeping the IPU running.

In order to load and start a core with an executable, you can do the
following after having launched the resource manager:

::

    target# echo <slave executable file path> > /dev/ipc-file/<core name>
    target# echo 1 > /dev/ipc-state/<core name>

The first command sets the filename of an executable to be loaded, and
the second command loads and starts the core with that executable.

To stop and unload a core, use the following command:

::

    target# echo 0 > /dev/ipc-state/<core name>

Keep in mind that this simply puts the core into reset. If there is any
on-going communication between the given core and the others, it is the
responsibility of the user application to clean up and terminate IPC on
the slave before unloading a core, thus to avoid causing any memory
leaks or communication errors.

Inspect the state of a slave core (IPC 3.23.01 and above)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To find out the state of a slave core (whether it is running or in
reset), issue the following command:

::

    target# cat /dev/ipc-state/<core name>

Tracing
'''''''''

When an issue arises, sometimes it is useful to see the output of
internal traces from IPC. This section talks about how to view IPC trace
from both the host and the slave cores on the QNX command prompt.

.. rubric:: Host-side trace output
   :name: host-side-trace-output

.. rubric:: Trace from IPC user libraries (IPC 3.35 and above)
   :name: trace-from-ipc-user-libraries-ipc-3.35-and-above

Trace output from the IPC user libraries is controlled using the
environment variable *IPC_DEBUG*, when launching an application that
uses IPC. E.g.:

::

    target# IPC_DEBUG=<level> app_host

where <level> can be set to a value between 1 and 3, with 3 being the
most verbose.

.. rubric:: Trace from IPC resource manager (IPC 3.35 and above)
   :name: trace-from-ipc-resource-manager-ipc-3.35-and-above

To show the trace output of the IPC resource manager in the QNX system
log, run the following command:

::

    target# sloginfo -m42

The verbosity of the trace can be controlled using the environment
variable *IPC_DEBUG_SLOG_LEVEL* when launching the IPC resource manager.
E.g.:

::

    target# IPC_DEBUG_SLOG_LEVEL=<level> ipc DSP1 ex02_messageq/debug/server_dsp1.xe66

where <level> can be set to a value between 0 and 7, with 7 being the
most verbose. The default level is 2.

.. rubric:: Slave-side trace output
   :name: slave-side-trace-output

To show all trace output (including IPC's) on a given slave core, simply
run the following

::

    target# cat /dev/ipc-trace/<core name>

where <core name> corresponds to the name of the slave core which trace
output you are interested in (e.g. DSP1, IPU1 or IPU2 for DRA7xx)

Note that older versions of IPC may use a slightly different path that
is based on the MultiProc id of the core of interest:
/dev/ipc-trace<id>.

Building the IPC resource manager in debug mode (IPC 3.35 and above)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When debugging an issue, the user may wish to have the ability to step
through the source code in the IPC resource manager. For this to happen,
the IPC resource manager needs to be built in debug mode with debug
symbols. Adding IPC_DEBUG=1 to the file <IPC_INSTALL_DIR>/qnx/Makefile
and rebuilding IPC would do the trick:

::

       ipc3x_dev: utils
           @cd src/ipc3x_dev; \
               make IPC_PLATFORM=$(IPC_PLATFORM) SMP=1 QNX_CFLAGS=$(QNX_CFLAGS) IPC_DEBUG=1

::

    target# make -f ipc-qnx.mak clean
    target# make -f ipc-qnx.mak all
