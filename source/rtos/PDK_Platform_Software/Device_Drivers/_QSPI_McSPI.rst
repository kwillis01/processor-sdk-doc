Introduction
------------

SPI driver enables communication for general SPI, MCSPI (Multichannel
SPI), QSPI (Quad SPI) and OSPI (Octal SPI) based peripherals on board
through common API to application.
MCSPI is a generic full-duplex interface supporting transmit and
receive of data over SPI bus. QSPI/OSPI is a variant of SPI supports four
receive data lanes. Driver supports configuration for either single,
dual, quad or octal data lines

Modes of Operation
------------------

Following modes of operations are supported:

**SPI_MODE_BLOCKING**
*SPI_transfer()* API blocks code execution until transaction has
completed. By default, SPI driver operates in blocking mode. This
ensures only one SPI transaction operates at a given time. This mode
is supported in both interrupt or non-interrupt configurations.

**SPI_MODE_CALLBACK**
*SPI_transfer()* API returns without waiting for completion of
transaction in this case. Callback function registered by application
is invoked once transaction is complete.This mode is supported only in
interrupt configuration.

Driver Configuration
--------------------

Board Specific Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All board specific configurations eg:enabling clock and pin-mux for SPI
pins are required before calling any driver APIs.By default Board_Init()
API supports all initialization sequence for TI supported EVMs. In
addition it initializes UART instance for Console/STDIO.Refer `Processor
SDK RTOS Board Support <index_board.html#board-support>`__
for additional details.Once board specific configuration is
complete \ *SPI_init()* API should be called to initialize driver.

SoC Specific Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All SoC specific configurations (eg: SPI module registers base address,
interrupt configurations, etc.) can be set using SPI_socSetInitCfg() SoC
driver API before calling any SPI driver APIs. The default SoC specific
configurations can be retrieved using SPI_socGetInitCfg() SoC driver
API. 

SPI Configuration Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *SPI_soc.c* file binds driver with hardware attributes on the board
through *SPI_config[]* structure. This structure must be provided to the
SPI driver. It must be initialized before the *SPI_init()* function is
called and cannot be changed afterwards. For details about individual
fields of this structure, see Doxygen help by opening
*PDK_INSTALL_DIR\packages\ti\drv\spi\docs\doxygen\html\index.html.*

Driver  requires common *SPI_config[]*  to configure hardware attributes
of MCSPI and QSPI/OSPI peripherals on SOC and board. First all MCSPI related
hardware attributes is defined followed by QSPI/OSPI hardware attributes.
Application will need to include appropriate offset to instance while
invoking *SPI_open()* API..

APIs

API Reference for application:

::

    #include <ti/drv/spi/SPI.h>

SPI IP V1 driver also supports multi-channel API's:

::

    #include <ti/drv/spi/MCSPI.h>

Open SPI
^^^^^^^^

::

    ...
    Board_init(boardCfg);
    ...
    SPI_socGetInitCfg(peripheralNum, &spi_cfg);
    ...
    SPI_socSetInitCfg(peripheralNum, &spi_cfg);
    SPI_Params_init(&spiParams);
    spiParams.transferMode = SPI_MODE_BLOCKING;
    spiParams.transferCallbackFxn = NULL;
    handle = SPI_open(peripheralNum, &spiParams);

SPI IP V1 driver also supports multi-channel open API's:

::

    ...
    Board_init(boardCfg);
    ...
    MCSPI_Params_init(&spiParams);
    spiParams.transferMode = SPI_MODE_BLOCKING;
    spiParams.transferCallbackFxn = NULL;
    handle = MCSPI_open(peripheralNum, channel, &spiParams);

|
At this point SPI driver is ready for data transfer in blocking mode
on specific instance identified by handle. Pseudo/Sample code for
SPI read/write transaction is included below. Refer example for
additional details

::

    ...
    spiTransaction.count = n;    /* Transfer Length */
    spiTransaction. txBuf = transmitBuffer; /* Buffer to be written */
    spiTransaction.rxBuf = NULL;  /* Buffer holding the received data */
    transferOK = SPI_transfer(spi, &spiTransaction); /* Perform SPI transfer */
    if (!transferOK) {
    /* SPI transaction failed */
    }

SPI IP V1 driver also supports multi-channel transfer API's:

::

    ...
    spiTransaction.count = n;    /* Transfer Length */
    spiTransaction. txBuf = transmitBuffer; /* Buffer to be written */
    spiTransaction.rxBuf = NULL;  /* Buffer holding the received data */
    transferOK = MCSPI_transfer(spi, &spiTransaction); /* Perform SPI transfer */
    if (!transferOK) {
    /* SPI transaction failed */
    }

.. note::

  SPI_open API supports configuration of data word length in the
  SPI_Params. Currently IP V1 driver (for AM3/4/5 devices) supports
  8/16/32-bit word length, IP V0 driver (for Keystone devices) supports
  8/16-bit word length.

Building SPI examples
----------------------

-  Makefile based examples and dependent libraries can be built from the top level or module level SPI makefile, refer to the `Processor SDK RTOS Getting Started Guide <index_overview.html#setup-environment>`__  for details of how to setup the build environment. Once you have setup the build environment, issue the following commands:
::

   To build and clean libs/apps from top-level makefile:
   cd <pdk>/packages
   make spi
   make spi_clean

   To build and clean libs/apps from module-level makefile:
   cd <pdk>/packages/ti/drv/spi
   make all
   make clean


-  RTSC CCS project based examples are built from CCS
::

   cd <pdk>/packages
   ./pdkProjectCreate.sh [soc] [board] [endian] spi [project type] [processor] [SECUREMODE=<yes/no>]
   Import and build CCS Project from  <pdk>/packages/MyExampleProjects/

OSPI Driver Configuration to support QSPI flash
-----------------------------------------------

If the board has a QSPI flash, the PDK driver needs to be updated to support the QSPI flash:

-  Board QSPI Flash Instance Configuration in board_cfg.h
::

    #define BOARD_QSPI_NOR_INSTANCE  <OSPI instance connected to QSPI flash>

-  SPI SoC Driver Configurations:
::

    ...
    OSPI_v0_HwAttrs ospi_cfg;

    SPI_init();

    OSPI_socGetInitCfg(BOARD_QSPI_NOR_INSTANCE, &ospi_cfg);
    ospi_cfg.xferLines      = OSPI_XFER_LINES_QUAD;
    ospi_cfg.pageSize       = <QSPI flash page size>;
    ospi_cfg.devDelays[0]   = <QSPI device delay>;
    ospi_cfg.devDelays[1]   = <QSPI device delay>;
    ospi_cfg.devDelays[2]   = <QSPI device delay>;
    ospi_cfg.devDelays[3]   = <QSPI device delay>;
    ospi_cfg.rdDataCapDelay = <QSPI read capture delay>;
    OSPI_socSetInitCfg(BOARD_OSPI_NOR_INSTANCE, &ospi_cfg);
