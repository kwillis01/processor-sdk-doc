System Benchmarks
-------------------

LMBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor
memory system performance.

**Latency**: lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: bw_mem_bcopy-N, where N is is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achivable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STREAM is a microbenchmarks for measuring data memory system performance without
any data reuse. It is designed to miss on caches and exercise data prefetcher and
apeculative accesseses. it uses double precision floating point (64bit) but in
most modern processors the memory access will be the bottleck. The four individual
scores are copy, scale as in multiply by constant, add two numbers, and triad for
multiply accumulate. For bandwidth a byte read counts as one and a byte written
counts as one resulting in a score that is double the bandwidth LMBench will show.

CoreMarkPro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CoreMark®-Pro is a comprehensive, advanced processor benchmark that works with
and enhances the market-proven industry-standard EEMBC CoreMark® benchmark.
While CoreMark stresses the CPU pipeline, CoreMark-Pro tests the entire processor,
adding comprehensive support for multicore technology, a combination of integer
and floating-point workloads, and data sets for utilizing larger memory subsystems.



Table:  **CoreMarkPro**

MultiBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MultiBench™ is a suite of benchmarks that allows processor and system designers to
analyze, test, and improve multicore processors. It uses three forms of concurrency:
Data decomposition: multiple threads cooperating on achieving a unified goal and
demonstrating a processor’s support for fine grain parallelism.
Processing multiple data streams: uses common code running over multiple threads and
demonstrating how well a processor scales over scalable data inputs.
Multiple workload processing: shows the scalability of general-purpose processing,
demonstrating concurrency over both code and data.
MultiBench combines a wide variety of application-specific workloads with the EEMBC
Multi-Instance-Test Harness (MITH), compatible and portable with most any multicore
processors and operating systems. MITH uses a thread-based API (POSIX-compliant) to
establish a common programming model that communicates with the benchmark through an
abstraction layer and provides a flexible interface to allow a wide variety of
thread-enabled workloads to be tested.



Table:  **Multibench**

Spec2K6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CPU2006 is a set of benchmarks designed to test the CPU performance of a modern server
computer system. It is split into two components, the first being CINT2006,
the other being CFP2006 (SPECfp), for floating point testing.

SPEC defines a base runtime for each of the 12 benchmark programs.
For SPECint2006, that number ranges from 1000 to 3000 seconds. The timed test is run on
the system, and the time of the test system is compared to the reference time, and a ratio
is computed. That ratio becomes the SPECint score for that test. (This differs from the rating
in SPECINT2000, which multiplies the ratio by 100.)

As an example for SPECint2006, consider a processor which can run 400.perlbench in 2000 seconds.
The time it takes the reference machine to run the benchmark is 9770 seconds. Thus the ratio is 4.885.
Each ratio is computed, and then the geometric mean of those ratios is computed to produce an overall value.

  **IMPORTANT**: The performance numbers can be severely affected if the media is
  mounted in sync mode. Hot plug scripts in the filesystem mount
  removable media in sync mode to ensure data integrity. For performance
  sensitive applications, umount the auto-mounted filesystem and
  re-mount in async mode.

  **IMPORTANT**: For Mass-storage applications, the performance numbers can be severely
  affected if the media is mounted in sync mode. Hot plug scripts in the

  integrity. For performance sensitive applications, umount the
  auto-mounted filesystem and re-mount in async mode.
